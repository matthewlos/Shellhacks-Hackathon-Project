"""Check that every skill and command means the same thing to every runtime.

These files are read by more than one agent runtime — Claude Code, Copilot CLI,
VS Code Agent Skills, and anything else that loads Agent Skills — and each one
parses the YAML frontmatter with a real YAML parser. Issue #27 is what happens
when a file means one thing to us and another thing to them:

    argument-hint: [product or feature to research]     # a LIST in YAML
    argument-hint: "[product or feature to research]"   # a STRING in YAML

Claude Code rendered the accidental list by concatenation, so it looked fine.
Copilot CLI >= 1.0.65 validates the field as a string, rejected the skill, and
the command silently vanished from its menu. Four skills shipped that way until
an outside contributor debugged it (#28).

scripts/lint-frontmatter.py once parsed frontmatter by hand, splitting each
line on the first ":", so the broken form reached it as the string
"[product or feature to research]" and passed its bracket check while every
real runtime saw a list. That gap is why this script was written, and it is
now closed at the source: the linter parses with PyYAML too, so the two can no
longer disagree about what a file says.

What remains here is the question the linter does not ask — not "is this file
correct?" but "will each runtime actually load it?" It checks:

  - the frontmatter block exists and parses as a YAML mapping
  - every field value is a plain string, not a value YAML silently coerced
    into a list, bool, number, null, or nested mapping
  - required fields are present for each file kind
  - every local plugin ships a valid Gemini extension manifest and a non-empty
    context file

The first three overlap with the linter by design. They are cheap, and they
state the runtime contract in one place rather than leaving it implicit in
another script's house rules.

Run it:

    python3 scripts/check-runtimes.py
    python3 scripts/check-runtimes.py --explain    # show the parse of each file

Requires PyYAML. Using a real YAML parser is the entire point — hand-rolling
one here would reintroduce the class of bug this script exists to catch.
